# Algorithms-with-CSharp
An algorithm represents a sequence of logical and computational steps required to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Algorithms are used by computer programs that process data and make decisions. The fundamental characteristics of an algorithm are as follows:

Input: The data or information required for the algorithm to operate.
Output: The data or information obtained as a result of the algorithm.
Definiteness: Each step is precisely and unambiguously defined.
Effectiveness: Each step can be executed effectively.
Finiteness: The algorithm terminates within a finite time.
Feasibility: Each step is feasible and meaningful.
